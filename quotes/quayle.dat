cannot beat a better offense."  In other words a good offense wins.

Right now we have a theory of mutually assured destruction that supposedly
provides for peace and stability, and it's worked.  But that doesn't mean
that we can't build upon a concept of MAD where both sides are vulnerable
to another attack.  Why wouldn't an enhanced deterrent, a more stable
peace, a better prospect to denying the ones who enter conflict in the
first place to have a reduction of offensive systems and an introduction
to defensive capability.  I believe that is the route this country will
eventually go.

Mars is essentially in the same orbit... Mars is somewhat the same distance

family, but that is a family and family values.

family, and I am proud of my family. Anybody turns to their family. I have

want to say thank you. The first would be our family. Your family, my
family -- which is composed of an immediate family of a wife and three
children, a larger family with grandparents and aunts and uncles. We all
have our family, whichever that may be ... The very beginnings of
civilization, the very beginnings of this country, goes back to the family.
And time and time again, I'm often reminded, especially in this
Presidential campaign, of the importance of a family, and what a family
means to this country. And so when you pay thanks I suppose the first thing
that would come to mind would be to thank the Lord for the family.

You always learn something by reading the classics.  Particularly The 
Prince.  I go through and look at this from this intellectual point of 
view.  Machiavelli had these three classes of mind.  The first class was 
the person that was creative enough to be leader and be able to lead a 
great nation without much help.  The second class of mind was one that 
wasn't creative but could take ideas, put people around him, and be able 
to lead nations forward.  And the third class of people didn't really know 
much of anything.  And they were the worst kind of leaders, because not 
only were they not creative, but they didn't know what was right or wrong, 
and they just sort of went by whatever they felt like. 
I've tried to figure out where I am.  I know I'm not the first because I don't
think I have the creativeness that Machiavelli talks about.  If I go back and
reread it I might figure it out exactly where I put myself.  I'm somewhere
between two and one.

Our trick, Rush - not a trick, our challenge - our challenge is to make the
American people comfortable with the leadership George Bush will offer in 
the next four years.

   If you elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore that would be a disaster for
agriculture.  What Bill Clinton says he'll do, well, I'll tell you what 
I'm going to do is to give a lot of balance to the interest here in California.
What we would have is an environmental summit, and guess who's going to be the
head of that enironmental summit? It's not going to be the Governor of
Arkansas. He's going to put Senator Al Gore in charge of the environmental
summit and his book will be the agenda for that environmental summit.
  I hope everyone reads that book.  We wanted to take that book to our debate, 
but for some reason Al Gore didn't want us to have the book in the debate 
because we wanted to make sure everyone knew what was in that book.  Because
that's the agenda for Bill Clinton.  That's the agenda of the Clinton-Gore
administration. Here's what he says about farmers.  Here's what he says 
about agriculture in that book.  He says that farmers strip-mine the land.
He says that agriculture is in fact bulldozing the Garden of Eden.  Well I
tell you what, if you elect Bill Clinton and Al Gore you can say goodbye to
water, goodbye to food, and goodbye to your jobs. But come November the 3'rd,
the American people are going to say good-bye to Bill Clinton and Al Gore.

[David Broder: Doesn't that sound like a case where the public is
getting shafted and there may be a need for local regulation or F.C.C.
regulation?]
Yeah. There is F.C.C. regulation. There is regulation.
[There's not control of rates or service.]
That's true, but there is ----
[Well, tell me in simple terms that people can understand: Why shouldn't 
they be regulated?]
O.K., simple terms, here's the choice. Here's the choice in simple
terms. Are you going to try to constrain the price increase through
regulation or through genuine competition? Our preference is to do it
through genuine competition.
[But there isn't genuine competition.]
That's right. Because you have -- but the cities that grant these
things can certainly be more competitive and have more openness if
they're ----
[So your suggestion is that they go out and have two or three
different companies wire these communities to get competition?]

It was a good campaign contribution to Bill Clinton, but he gets a lot of 
contributions from Hollywood.  We're making great progress with Hollywood. 
I am convinced because of my speech of several months ago on the poverty of 
values in this country that Hollywood will begin to reflect our values better.
