It's hard to believe that something which is neither seen nor
  felt can do so much harm.
That's true.  But an idea can't be seen or felt.  And that's

%
Vulcans never bluff.
    -- Spock, "The Doomsday Machine," stardate 4202.1.

%
I object to intellect without discipline; I object to power without
  constructive purpose.

We Klingons believe as you do -- the sick should die.  Only the
  strong should live.
    -- Kras, "Friday's Child," stardate 3497.2.
%
I thought my people would grow tired of killing.  But you were
  right, they see it is easier than trading.  And it has its
  pleasures.  I feel it myself.  Like the hunt, but with richer
  rewards.
    -- Apella, "A Private Little War," stardate 4211.8.

We do not colonize.  We conquer.  We rule.  There is no other way
  for us.
    -- Rojan, "By Any Other Name," stardate 4657.5.

%
Sometimes a feeling is all we humans have to go on.
    -- Kirk, "A Taste of Armageddon," stardate 3193.9.
%
The release of emotion is what keeps us healthy.  Emotionally healthy.
That may be, Doctor.  However, I have noted that the healthy release
  of emotion is frequently unhealthy for those closest to you.
    -- McCoy and Spock, "Plato's Stepchildren," stardate 5784.3.

%
One does not thank logic.
    -- Sarek, "Journey to Babel," stardate 3842.4.

-- the other side of the coin.
    -- Dr. Roger Corby and Kirk, "What are Little Girls Made Of?,"
       stardate 2712.4
%
Without facts, the decision cannot be made logically.  You must
  rely on your human intuition.
    -- Spock, "Assignment:  Earth," stardate unknown.
%
You say you are lying.  But if everything you say is a lie, then you
  are telling the truth.  You cannot tell the truth because everything
  you say is a lie.  You lie, you tell the truth ... but you cannot,
  for you lie.
    -- Norman the android, "I, Mudd," stardate 4513.3.

It is more rational to sacrifice one life than six.
    -- Spock, "The Galileo Seven," stardate 2822.3.

  and death --
And make them spend it on life.
    -- Edith Keeler and Kirk, "The City on the Edge of Forever,"
       stardate unknown.

Our missions are peaceful -- not for conquest.  When we do battle,
  it is only because we have no choice.
    -- Kirk, "The Squire of Gothos," stardate 2124.5.
%
We fight only when there is no other choice.  We prefer the ways of

%
If some day we are defeated, well, war has its fortunes, good and bad.
    -- Commander Kor, "Errand of Mercy," stardate 3201.7.
%
It's [war is] instinctive.  But the instinct can be fought. We're
  human beings with the blood of a million savage years on our hands!
  But we can stop it.  We can admit that we're killers...but we're not
  going to kill today.  That's all it takes!  Knowing that we're not
  going to kill today!
    -- Kirk, "A Taste of Armageddon," stardate 3193.0.

  But you imprison those who employ it privately.
    -- Spock, "Dagger of the Mind," stardate 2715.1.

  in this way?...  Obedience.  Duty.  Death, and more death...
    -- Romulan Commander, "Balance of Terror," stardate 1709.2.

There's no honorable way to kill, no gentle way to destroy.  There
  is nothing good in war.  Except its ending.

%
No one wants war.
    -- Kirk, "Errand of Mercy," stardate 3201.7.

%
Peace was the way.
    -- Kirk, "The City on the Edge of Forever," stardate unknown.

%
Do you know the one -- "All I ask is a tall ship...and a star to
  steer her by..."  You could feel the wind at your back, about you...
  the sounds of the sea beneath you.  And even if you take away the
  wind and the water, it's still the same.  The ship is yours...you
  can feel her...and the stars are still there.
    -- Kirk, "The Ultimate Computer," stardate 4729.4.
%
I've already got a female to worry about.  Her name is the Enterprise.

Either one of us, by himself, is expendable.  Both of us are not.
    -- Kirk, "The Devil in the Dark," stardate 3196.1.
%
Computers make excellent and efficient servants, but I have no
  wish to serve under them.  Captain, a starship also runs on
  loyalty to one man.  And nothing can replace it or him.
    -- Spock, "The Ultimate Computer," stardate 4729.4.
%
I realize that command does have its fascination, even under
  circumstances such as these, but I neither enjoy the idea of command
  nor am I frightened of it.  It simply exists, and I will do whatever
  logically needs to be done.
    -- Spock, "The Galileo Seven," stardate 2812.7.
%
The only solution is...a balance of power.  We arm our side with
  exactly that much more.  A balance of power -- the trickiest,
  most difficult, dirtiest game of them all.  But the only one that
  preserves both sides.
    -- Kirk, "A Private Little War," stardate 4211.8.
%
You speak of courage.  Obviously you do not know the difference

%
First study the enemy.  Seek weakness.
    -- Romulan Commander, "Balance of Terror," stardate 1709.2.

Worlds may change, galaxies disintegrate, but a woman

Women are more easily and more deeply terrified ... generating
  more sheer horror than the male of the species.
    -- Spock, "Wolf in the Fold," stardate 3615.4.
%
That unit is a woman.
A mass of conflicting impulses.

It's my understanding that one of the duties of the First Officer on a
  Klingon ship is to assassinate the Captain.
Yes, sir. When and if the Captain becomes weak and unable to perform,
  it is expected that his honorable retirement should be assisted by his
  First. The Second Officer would assassinate you for the same reasons.
This method of attrition could take a little getting used to.

I know I can count on every Klingon warrior on this crew to serve and

I have been assigned here to serve this ship and to obey your orders. I
  will do exactly that.
Will you take an oath to that effect.
I just did.

That is how a Klingon lures a mate.
Are you telling me to yell at Salia?
No, no, no. Men do not roar. Women roar. Then they hurl heavy
  objects. And claw at you.
What does the man do?
He reads love poetry. He ducks a lot.
Worf, it sounds like it works great for the Klingons, but...I
  think I need to try something a little less...dangerous?
Go to her door, beg like a human.
    -- Worf and Wesley, "The Dauphin", stardate 42568.8

It should be that simple, Wesley. Judging by her appearance, it is
  likely you and Salia are biologically compatible. Of course, there

Now, the first words out of your mouth are the most important. You may
  want to start with something like this here. You are the most
  beautiful woman in the galaxy. but that might not work.
Yes! Yes, it would.
You don't know how long I've wanted to tell you that.
But you were afraid.
Yes.
Of me?
Of us. Of what we might become.
    -- Riker and Guinan, "The Dauphin", stardate 42568.8

Or that you might think it was a line.
Maybe I do think it's a line.
Then you think I'm not sincere.
I didn't say that. There's nothing wrong with a line. It's like
  knocking at the door.
Then you're inviting me in?
I'm not sending you away.
That's more than I expected.
Is it as much as you hoped?
To hope is to recognize the possibility. I had only dreams.
Dreams can be dangerous.
Not these dreams. I dream of a galaxy where your eyes are the stars,
  and the universe worships the night.
Careful! Putting me on a pedestal so high, you might not be able
  to reach me.
Then I'll learn how to fly. You are the heart of my day, and the
